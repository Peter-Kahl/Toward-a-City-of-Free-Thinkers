### Abstract

_Toward a City of Free Thinkers: From the Precipice of Knowledge to the Horizons of Emancipation_ is a multimodal odyssey in seven movements — from the dependency of the student, through the theatre of the university and the seal of accreditation, to the crack of doubt, the act of self-emancipation, and finally the manifesto that opens onto a city of free thinkers. Each stage is rendered through poetry, essay, and image, treated as coequal epistemic registers: the poem enacts, the prose situates, the image exposes. This form is not ornamental but methodological. To resist epistemic domestication, philosophy must refuse monomodality.

The work diagnoses universities and allied institutions as theatres of epistemic clientelism, where recognition is exchanged for conformity and accreditation substitutes for truth. It shows how practices of accreditation and peer review often operate as systemic gatekeeping mechanisms that produce epistemic injustice by design. Drawing on Foucault and Bourdieu, it situates these dynamics as theatres of visibility and silence, where authority is aestheticised and dissent suppressed.

Against this order, the work advances the case for fiduciary openness: epistemic authorities must be bound by duties of care, loyalty, and accountability to truth itself. It envisions epistemocracy, a form of governance in which plurality is structurally safeguarded and institutions act not as sovereign gatekeepers but as stewards of the commons.

The cycle culminates in a manifesto of unfettered thought, proposing a reimagined motto for knowledge: _Epistemic Liberty, Equality of Voices, Fraternity of Free Thinkers_. It calls for a city where silence is fertile rather than imposed, libraries are gardens rather than prisons of paper, and knowledge circulates not as property but as fiduciary trust. The invitation is collective: to breathe together in the open space created when certainty falls and doubt begins.

### Author’s Note on Publication

This work is published as two independent but parallel versions — one in English, one in [French](https://github.com/Peter-Kahl/Vers-une-cite-des-libres-penseurs) — to test and exemplify epistemic plurality across linguistic domains.

_Toward a City of Free Thinkers: From the Precipice of Knowledge to the Horizons of Emancipation_ (English) and [_Vers une cité des libres penseurs : Du précipice du savoir aux horizons de l’émancipation_](https://github.com/Peter-Kahl/Vers-une-cite-des-libres-penseurs) (French) are more than parallel publications. They are acts of epistemic freedom in themselves.

This work resists the usual boundaries of philosophy. It is not just a treatise or a collection of poems, but a multimodal inquiry — poetry, essay, and image speaking as equal registers of thought. To think freely is not only to critique institutions of knowledge, accreditation, and silence, but to refuse the constraint of a single idiom.

Publishing in English situates the project within debates on epistemic injustice, fiduciary duties, and epistemic democracy. Publishing in French places it within the lineage of Foucault, Bourdieu, Derrida, and Fanon — traditions that have long interrogated power, silence, and emancipation. Together, they insist that critique must be polyphonic, not confined to one linguistic domain.

This bilingual manifesto enacts what it argues: that knowledge should not be sealed, owned, or monopolised, but shared as fiduciary trust. It invites readers to doubt, to refuse, and to imagine a _city of free thinkers_ where truth circulates as common ground.
